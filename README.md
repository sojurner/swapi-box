SWAPI Box is a paired project designed to challenge my skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components, as well as obtaining complete testing coverage through unit and assurance tests.  

## Goals for this project

* Get comfortable fetching APIs, testing, and cleaning data.
* Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
* Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
* Use propTypes to validate props passed to each component.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.
* Implement React Router.
